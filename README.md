Certainly! Here's a section addressing synchrotrons and related facilities, including those working with protons and neutron sources:


#### Synchrotrons at Neutron Sources

While synchrotrons are primarily associated with electron accelerators, other facilities, such as neutron sources, also operate synchrotrons that use different types of particles. Notably, these facilities use protons or other particles rather than electrons. Here are some examples:

- **[Spallation Neutron Source (SNS)](https://www.sns.gov/)**: Located at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the SNS generates neutrons through spallation, a process involving protons rather than electrons. The facility includes a proton accelerator and neutron production targets.

- **[European Spallation Source (ESS)](https://europeanspallationsource.se/)**: An upcoming major neutron source in Sweden, the ESS will use protons to generate neutrons for research across various scientific disciplines. The facility aims to deliver advanced neutron beamlines for materials science, biology, and physics.

- **[J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex)](http://j-parc.jp/)**: Located in Japan, J-PARC is a multi-purpose facility that includes a high-intensity proton accelerator and neutron source. It provides neutron beams for a variety of research applications.

- **[ISIS Neutron and Muon Source](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/)**: Based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK, ISIS uses protons to produce neutrons and muons, supporting research in materials science, engineering, and other fields.

#### Synchrotrons at CERN

CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, is known for its particle accelerators and collider experiments. Although CERN does not have a synchrotron dedicated to synchrotron radiation in the traditional sense, it does operate several synchrotron facilities and accelerators that use protons and other particles:

- **[Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/physics/large-hadron-collider)**: The LHC is a proton synchrotron and the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator. It accelerates protons and heavy ions to near the speed of light and collides them to study fundamental particles and forces.

- **[Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS)](https://home.cern/science/experiments/super-proton-synchrotron)**: The SPS is an intermediate accelerator at CERN, used to accelerate protons and heavy ions before they are injected into the LHC.

- **[Proton Synchrotron (PS)](https://home.cern/science/experiments/proton-synchrotron)**: The PS was CERN's first proton synchrotron and serves as an important component in the chain of accelerators, providing protons for various experiments, including those at the SPS and LHC.

These facilities illustrate the diverse applications of synchrotron technology beyond traditional synchrotron radiation sources, including the use of protons and neutrons for scientific research.
